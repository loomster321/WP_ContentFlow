## üîç Automated Fix Attempt - Failed

### What Was Attempted
The following fix was applied based on the approved plan:
- Removed `isGenerating` from saved block attributes (UI state only)
- Changed from attribute to local React state using `useState`
- Updated block deprecation for backward compatibility
- Rebuilt and deployed the plugin

### Test Results
#### Before Fix
- **Status**: FAILED ‚úÖ (Expected failure)
- **Error**: 500 Internal Server Error - Issue reproduced

#### After Fix
- **Status**: FAILED ‚ùå
- **Error**: 500 Internal Server Error - Issue reproduced

### Why The Fix Didn't Work
The same error persists after the fix, indicating:
- The root cause is not in the JavaScript block code
- The 500 error is likely from server-side PHP processing
- The block validation issue was a symptom, not the cause

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Build System**: Files were built to wrong location initially (root instead of plugin directory)
2. **Test Framework**: Playwright global setup conflicts required standalone test runner
3. **Error Source**: 500 error originates from WordPress REST API, not block editor

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **Check PHP Error Logs**: The 500 error on `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/` indicates server-side issue
2. **Debug REST API Handler**: Examine the WordPress REST API save post handler
3. **Check Plugin Activation**: Verify all database tables and options are properly initialized
4. **Review PHP Code**: Look for issues in:
   - `wp-content-flow.php` main plugin file
   - REST API endpoint handlers
   - Database save operations

### Recommendation
This appears to be a **server-side PHP issue**, not a JavaScript/block editor problem. Manual debugging of the WordPress REST API endpoint is required to identify the actual cause of the 500 error.
