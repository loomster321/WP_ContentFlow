# GI-Fix Command Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
The `/gi-fix` command was declaring fixes as successful without actually verifying that the user's problem was solved. It would:
- Edit code files ✅
- Compile successfully ✅  
- Check for text patterns ✅
- Then claim "Fix verified!" ❌

**But it never tested if the actual issue was fixed!**

## Critical Changes Made

### 1. MANDATORY Regression Testing
**Before:** Could mark as `human-qa` just because code compiled
**After:** MUST run regression test that reproduces exact issue

### 2. Before/After Test Requirements
The command MUST now:
1. Create test that reproduces the EXACT issue
2. Run test BEFORE fix - must FAIL (proving issue exists)
3. Apply the fix
4. Run SAME test AFTER fix - must PASS (proving issue solved)
5. Capture screenshots as evidence

### 3. New Label: `blocked`
**Scenario:** Fix applied but test environment broken
**Before:** Would mark as `human-qa` anyway
**After:** Marks as `blocked` - acknowledges fix unverified

### 4. Clear Success Criteria
A fix can ONLY be marked `human-qa` when:
- ✅ Regression test created
- ✅ Test failed before fix
- ✅ Test passed after fix
- ✅ Screenshot captured
- ✅ Specific error gone

### 5. Explicit Failure Documentation
If test cannot run, the command MUST report:
```markdown
## ⚠️ Fix Applied But UNVERIFIED - Environment Blocked
Code changed but cannot confirm if issue is fixed.
Label: blocked (NOT human-qa)
```

## Example: Issue #5 (Editor Crash)

### OLD Behavior (What Went Wrong)
1. Changed code to use RichText instead of dangerouslySetInnerHTML
2. Code compiled successfully
3. Checked if pattern was in built file
4. Marked as `human-qa` ✅
5. **Never tested if posts could actually be saved!**

### NEW Required Behavior
1. Create test: Login → Add Block → Save Post
2. Run test - must get 500 error (issue exists)
3. Apply fix (change to RichText)
4. Run SAME test - must save successfully
5. Capture screenshot of saved post
6. ONLY THEN mark as `human-qa`

## Key Safeguards Added

### Things That Are NOT Sufficient Evidence:
- ❌ "Code compiled successfully"
- ❌ "Pattern found/removed in code"
- ❌ "Files were edited"
- ❌ "Build succeeded"
- ❌ "JavaScript has no syntax errors"

### What IS Required:
- ✅ The EXACT user problem is tested
- ✅ The SPECIFIC error is gone
- ✅ Screenshot proves it works
- ✅ User workflow completes successfully

## Regression Test Template (Plain English)

Every fix MUST include this documentation:

```markdown
## Regression Test for Issue #X

### Test Steps:
1. [Exact step from issue - e.g., "Login to WordPress admin"]
2. [Exact step from issue - e.g., "Navigate to Posts → Add New"]
3. [Exact step from issue - e.g., "Add AI Text Generator block"]
4. [Exact step from issue - e.g., "Click Save Draft"]

### Before Fix:
- ERROR: [What fails - e.g., "500 error, post doesn't save"]
- Screenshot: issue-X-before-fix.png

### After Fix:
- SUCCESS: [What works - e.g., "Post saves successfully"]
- Screenshot: issue-X-after-fix.png
```

## Summary

The command now enforces that **changing code ≠ fixing the problem**.

Only when the exact user problem is tested and proven fixed can an issue be marked for human QA. This prevents false positives and ensures fixes actually work for users.

## Implementation Files Updated
1. `.claude/commands/gi-fix.md` - Complete documentation with mandatory regression testing
2. `.claude/commands/gi-fix.js` - JavaScript implementation with new requirements

## Next Steps for Human
- Review these changes
- Ensure all future uses of `/gi-fix` follow regression testing requirements
- Never accept "fix verified" without screenshot evidence of the actual issue being resolved
