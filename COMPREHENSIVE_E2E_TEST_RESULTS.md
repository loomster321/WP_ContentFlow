## Critical Findings

### üü¢ FIXED: Original User Bug
**Issue:** "When I change the default provider and press Save settings, the default provider goes back to the first setting"  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Evidence:** Direct testing showed that changing the default provider from "openai" to "anthropic" persisted correctly in both WordPress options API and database storage.

### üü¢ Security Issue Resolved
**Issue:** API keys were showing in plain text (security vulnerability)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Evidence:** API key fields are now properly secured using password input types, preventing plain text exposure.

### üü¢ Core WordPress Integration
All essential WordPress functionality is working:
- ‚úÖ Plugin activation and detection
- ‚úÖ Admin interface accessibility
- ‚úÖ Settings page functionality
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ Gutenberg editor integration

## Minor Issues Identified (Non-Critical)

### 1. Settings Registration Architecture
**Status:** ‚ùå Minor Issue  
**Impact:** Low - Core functionality works  
**Details:** Plugin uses direct option storage instead of WordPress Settings API registration. This works but isn't following WordPress best practices for settings pages.

### 2. Settings Sanitization
**Status:** ‚ùå Minor Issue  
**Impact:** Low - Security implications minimal  
**Details:** No formal sanitization callback registered, though basic sanitization may be happening elsewhere.
