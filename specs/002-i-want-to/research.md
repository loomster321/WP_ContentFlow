# Research Findings: WordPress AI Content Workflow Plugin

## 1. AI Service Integration Patterns

**Decision**: WordPress REST API + Custom Database Tables + Asynchronous Processing

**Rationale**: 
- WordPress REST API provides standardized endpoints with built-in authentication and security
- Custom database tables offer better performance for complex AI workflow data
- Asynchronous processing prevents blocking the editor experience during AI operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct AJAX calls - Rejected due to limited error handling and security concerns
- Using only wp_options table - Rejected due to performance issues with large datasets
- Third-party API wrappers - Rejected to maintain control over security and caching

## 2. Gutenberg Block Editor Extensions

**Decision**: Custom Gutenberg Blocks + Block Editor Extensions + Server-Side Rendering

**Rationale**:
- React-based architecture aligns with Gutenberg's native technology stack
- WordPress Block API provides secure hooks for extending editor functionality
- Server-side AI processing maintains security and performance consistency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side AI processing - Rejected due to API key exposure and security concerns
- Third-party block libraries - Rejected to maintain plugin independence
- Editor plugins only - Rejected as blocks provide better user experience

## 3. WordPress Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Normalized Custom Tables + WordPress Metadata Integration

**Rationale**:
- Custom tables avoid key-value limitations for complex AI relationship data
- Proper foreign keys and indexes optimize AI workflow performance
- WordPress metadata integration maintains compatibility with core features

**Database Structure**:
```sql
-- AI Workflows table
CREATE TABLE wp_ai_workflows (
    id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ai_provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    settings LONGTEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive') DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- AI Suggestions table  
CREATE TABLE wp_ai_suggestions (
    id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
    post_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    workflow_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    original_content LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
    suggested_content LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES wp_posts(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES wp_ai_workflows(id)
);
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- WordPress core tables only - Rejected due to performance limitations
- External database - Rejected due to hosting complexity requirements

## 4. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: Multi-Layer Caching + Background Processing + Rate Limiting

**Rationale**:
- WordPress transients provide built-in caching for API responses
- Background job processing prevents editor blocking during AI operations
- Rate limiting controls API costs and prevents abuse

**Caching Strategy**:
- AI responses: 30 minutes (frequently changing)
- Workflow templates: 24 hours (stable configuration)
- User suggestions: 1 hour (moderate volatility)

**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching - Rejected due to API costs and poor user experience
- File-based caching - Rejected due to scalability issues
- Database-only caching - Rejected due to performance limitations

## 5. WordPress Plugin Security Requirements

**Decision**: Multi-Layer Security + Encrypted API Key Storage + Content Filtering

**Rationale**:
- WordPress security standards ensure plugin review compliance
- Encrypted API key storage prevents credential exposure
- Content filtering protects against malicious AI-generated content

**Security Implementation**:
- Nonce verification for all AI requests
- User capability checks based on WordPress roles
- Input sanitization using WordPress core functions
- Output escaping for all AI-generated content
- API key encryption and secure storage

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic authentication only - Rejected as insufficient for production
- Client-side security - Rejected due to inherent vulnerabilities
- Third-party security services - Rejected to reduce dependencies

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Component | Technology Choice | Primary Reason |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| AI Integration | WordPress REST API | Security + Standards Compliance |
| Editor Extension | Gutenberg Blocks | Native React Integration |
| Data Storage | Custom Tables + WP Metadata | Performance + Compatibility |
| Performance | Multi-layer Caching | Cost Control + User Experience |
| Security | WordPress Core Standards | Plugin Review Requirements |

## Implementation Requirements

**WordPress Compatibility**: 6.0+ (Gutenberg block editor required)
**PHP Version**: 8.1+ (WordPress recommendation)
**Database**: MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
**JavaScript**: ES6+ with React components for blocks

All technical decisions align with WordPress plugin review guidelines and support production deployment requirements.
