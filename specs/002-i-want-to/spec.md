# Feature Specification: WordPress AI Content Workflow Plugin

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a plugin for wordpress and a content workflow architecture that allows AI to beused directly inside the wordpress editor, I have alot of information in documents I can share."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators and editors working in WordPress want to enhance their writing process by leveraging AI assistance directly within the familiar WordPress editor environment. They need to access AI capabilities for content generation, editing suggestions, and workflow automation without leaving their editing workspace or switching between multiple tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a content creator is writing a blog post in WordPress editor, **When** they select text and request AI assistance, **Then** they receive relevant content suggestions or improvements inline
2. **Given** an editor is reviewing content, **When** they activate the AI workflow tools, **Then** they can apply automated content checks and enhancements to their posts
3. **Given** a user wants to generate new content, **When** they use the AI content generation feature, **Then** they can create draft content based on their prompts and parameters
4. **Given** multiple users are collaborating on content, **When** they use the workflow features, **Then** they can coordinate their editing process with AI-assisted reviews and approvals
5. **Given** a user has existing content, **When** they apply AI workflow automation, **Then** the system processes their content according to predefined workflow rules

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI services are unavailable or respond with errors?
- How does the system handle very long content that exceeds AI processing limits?
- What occurs when multiple users simultaneously use AI features on the same content?
- How are AI-generated suggestions handled when they conflict with existing content structure?
- What happens when workflow automation encounters content that doesn't meet predefined criteria?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate AI capabilities directly into the WordPress block editor interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to generate content based on text prompts and parameters [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what types of content - articles, summaries, headlines, etc.?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide content editing suggestions and improvements for selected text
- **FR-004**: System MUST support workflow automation for content creation and review processes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific workflow steps need automation?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve WordPress content structure and formatting during AI operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to accept, reject, or modify AI-generated suggestions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide content collaboration features for multiple editors [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what collaboration features are needed beyond standard WordPress?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle AI service errors gracefully without breaking the editor experience
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with WordPress user permissions and roles [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which roles should have access to AI features?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST store and manage AI-generated content history [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period and storage requirements?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide configurable AI parameters and settings [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what parameters need to be configurable?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which AI services/providers should be supported?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure AI operations do not significantly impact editor performance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable performance thresholds?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide audit trails for AI-assisted content changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: level of detail needed in audit logs?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Workflow**: Represents automated processes for content creation, editing, and approval with AI assistance
- **AI Suggestion**: Represents AI-generated content recommendations with original text reference, suggested changes, and user response
- **Workflow Template**: Represents reusable workflow configurations with AI parameters, processing steps, and approval criteria
- **Content History**: Represents versioning and change tracking for AI-assisted content modifications
- **User Preferences**: Represents individual user settings for AI behavior, workflow participation, and content preferences
