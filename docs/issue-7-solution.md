# Issue #7 Solution: WordPress Docker Environment 500 Error on Post Save

## Problem Summary
WordPress posts could not be saved in the Docker development environment, returning 500 errors on all POST requests to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`. This issue occurred regardless of plugin activation status, indicating an environment configuration problem rather than a plugin bug.

## Root Cause
The 500 errors were caused by multiple configuration issues in the Docker environment:

1. **Insufficient PHP memory limits** - Default WordPress memory limits were too low
2. **PHP error output in REST API responses** - PHP warnings/notices were corrupting JSON responses
3. **Missing uploads directory** - WordPress couldn't create necessary directories
4. **Improper file permissions** - wp-content directory lacked proper write permissions

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced PHP Configuration (`wp-php.ini`)
Created a comprehensive PHP configuration file with WordPress-optimized settings:
- Increased memory_limit to 512M
- Increased execution timeouts to 300 seconds
- Disabled error display in output (logs only)
- Enabled opcache for better performance
- Set proper database connection timeouts

### 2. Updated Docker Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
Modified the WordPress container configuration to:
- Mount the new PHP configuration file
- Set WordPress memory limits via WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA
- Disable error display to prevent JSON corruption
- Enable debug logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Fixed File Permissions
- Created wp-content/uploads directory
- Set proper ownership (www-data:www-data) for all wp-content files
- Ensured WordPress can write to necessary directories

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `diagnose-500.php` - Comprehensive system diagnostic script
- `test-post-save.php` - Direct post save verification script
- Playwright E2E tests for ongoing validation

## Verification Results

✅ **Database Operations**: Posts can be created, updated, and deleted successfully
✅ **REST API**: Clean JSON responses without PHP warnings
✅ **File Permissions**: WordPress can write to all necessary directories
✅ **Memory Limits**: Sufficient memory for WordPress operations (512M)

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/wp-php.ini` - PHP configuration optimized for WordPress
2. `/docker-compose.yml` - Updated with proper environment settings
3. `/diagnose-500.php` - Diagnostic script for troubleshooting
4. `/test-post-save.php` - Post save verification script
5. `/e2e/blocks/issue-7-post-save-fix.spec.js` - E2E test suite

## How to Apply This Fix

1. **Stop existing containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Apply the configuration files**:
   - Ensure `wp-php.ini` exists in project root
   - Update `docker-compose.yml` with the provided configuration

3. **Restart containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Fix permissions** (after containers start):
   ```bash
   docker exec wp_contentflow-wordpress-1 mkdir -p /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
   docker exec wp_contentflow-wordpress-1 chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wp-content
   ```

5. **Verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   docker exec wp_contentflow-wordpress-1 php /var/www/html/test-post-save.php
   ```

## Ongoing Monitoring

To ensure the issue doesn't recur:

1. **Check REST API responses**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/wp-json/wp/v2/posts | head -c 100
   ```
   Should return clean JSON without PHP warnings

2. **Run diagnostic script**:
   Access `http://localhost:8080/diagnose-500.php` to check system status

3. **Monitor debug log**:
   ```bash
   docker exec wp_contentflow-wordpress-1 tail -f /var/www/html/wp-content/debug.log
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always use proper PHP configuration for WordPress environments
2. Disable error display in production/testing environments
3. Ensure proper file permissions from the start
4. Set adequate memory limits for WordPress (minimum 256M, recommended 512M)
5. Test REST API responses for clean JSON output
